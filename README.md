I am a senior at Ton Duc Thang University. This is my undergraduate thesis of Accounting for purchasing and selling at Wincity Joint Stock Company. In the market mechanism, selling and purchasing are the most important steps. Purchasing is the premise to create the initial quantity of goods to deploy the entire business system of the enterprise. Therefore, purchasing is the opening operation of the business process of the enterprise, purchasing is the premise for selling and achieving profits. Sales is the process in which the seller learns, consults, and meets the needs and desires of the buyer in order to achieve satisfactory benefits from both sides. Sales activities are considered the foundation of business, with the purpose of building meetings, negotiating and exchanging products and benefits effectively. This graduation report demonstrates an overview of the accounting tasks of selling and purchasing goods at Wincity Joint Stock Company by using research method to achieve the objectives. The report also shows the weak points in their process and gives recommendations to the enterprise to change and develop in the future.
